each manager is responsible for a single branch and uses the management interface to create and manage terminals and cashiers within that branch. When a terminal is created, it is associated with the tenant and branch and then linked to a specific physical device; the device stores its last operating mode, either terminal mode or management mode. Cashiers are created by the manager, and the system automatically generates a temporary one-time PIN for each cashier, which is used only for initial access or after a reset. When a terminal device is opened in terminal mode, it loads the linked terminal and immediately displays a PIN pad that blocks all access. On first login or after a PIN reset, the cashier enters the temporary system-generated PIN and is forced to set a personal 4-digit PIN, after which the temporary PIN is invalidated and can never be reused. For normal operation, the cashier authenticates using only their personal PIN; PINs are validated within the branch scope, securely stored in hashed form, and collisions are prevented by design. A cashier is required to re-authenticate whenever the app is closed, minimized, the device sleeps, or an idle timeout is reached, and shifts are implicitly derived from successful login and logout times. If a cashier forgets their PIN, the manager explicitly triggers a reset, which generates a new temporary PIN and repeats the initial setup flow. On application launch, the device checks its last stored mode and either opens the terminal directly with the PIN pad displayed or redirects to the management login screen, ensuring clear separation between cashier access and manager access, consistent enforcement of branch boundaries, and safe recovery from all common edge cases including forgotten PINs, device restarts, and inactive sessions.
